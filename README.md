Feedler
==========

Feedler is/was an RSS feed reader for the [Elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/) written by Daniel Kur, but others seems to have been (undocumentedly) involved as well. It has been unmaintained (or at least has no human-committed code) since at least March 2014, but those were minor tweaks. In practice, development seems to have effectively ceased in May 2013.

So, this is a ressurrection attempt, but it's mostly a way to teach myself the Elementary software development framework.

In other words: do not expect this code to be even remotely usable!

# To original authors, ElementaryOS devs etc #
I am not assuming responsibility for this piece of code, nor am I assuming authorship etc. So far, I am mostly toying around, because I learn better by repairing broken things than by creating things anew.

Also, the use of Git is not meant as a comment on Launchpad or Bazaar. I just did not want to learn a new issue tracker and VCS in addition to a new programming language, build system, and software framework.

However, if you are interested in supporting me, really want me to do this on Launchpad, or want to back-port any of my changes to the original code base, please give me a shout. I don't bite!
